1. The first problem is permission in apache2. The resolved method is to change the config file that is http.conf
2. The second problem is simplexml.
We can confirm the installed module in php thought command the php -m.
and I have done the install simplexml.

cmd] apt-get install php7.2-xml
cmd] apt-get install  php-simplexml

3. The third problem is .htaccess file.
The re-write mod is not installed.

cmd] a2enmod rewrite

4. php.ini was modified. That modified is the mysqli, xml-rpc.
